mount ssh dir and set GIT_SSH_COMMAND envvar: -v ~/.ssh:/ssh -e GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i /ssh/id_rsa"
  - will this work in windows? Maybe with docker-compose???

-e GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="name"
-e EMAIL=email


open question:
  can we mount the ssh key and repo dir on windows
  does interactivity in scripts work on windows?
    - maybe they can't run the monorepo command at all? (do they have the monorepo and can the contribute to it? does it live at ~/code?)
      - maybe we have a flag that skips this and they need to bug an engineer if they are launching markets themselves?
      - or buildkite does this???
  what command tool are ACTs going to use??? Powershell? the other ones?
  git config --get on windows? does it work?

wrapper script:
  - docker build
  - docker run `

docker run -v $(pwd):/app -v ~/.ssh:/ssh -e EMAIL=$(git config --get user.email) -e GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="$(git config --get user.name)" -it foo bash
